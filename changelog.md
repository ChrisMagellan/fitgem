# fitgem changelog

## v0.10.0

#### 2014-08-08 Zachery Moneypenny <fitgem@whazzmaster.com>

* Updates default test framework to RSpec 3
* Updates library to use SSL exclusively when hitting the Fitbit REST API. Fitbit is restricting access to its API via https only on November 3rd, 2014. See [issue #30](https://github.com/whazzmaster/fitgem/issues/30) for more information. This should be transparent to end users of fitgem, as the library simply ignores the :ssl option in the Client constructor and defaults to https everywhere.
* The previously-deprecated `weekly_leaderboard` and `monthly_leaderboard` methods have now been updated to throw a `DeprecatedApiError` rather than warning about deprecation. These methods will be removed in v1.0.

## v0.9.0

#### 2014-02-11 Zachery Moneypenny <fitgem@whazzmaster.com>

The v0.9.0 release adds a number of new methods to match new functionality available through the Fitbit REST API. It
also removes support for concepts (monthly leaderboards) that have been removed from the Fitbit REST API.

There's a big change to **leaderboard support** in this update; please read the notes below if you're currently using
`monthly_leaderboard` or `weekly_leaderboard` -- you should update your code to use the new method before v1.0 is
released.

* Add ability to target SSL Fitbit REST endpoints
* Add `activity_on_date_range` method
* Condense existing `weekly_leaderboard` and (no longer available) `monthly_leaderboard` into a simple `leaderboard`
method. There is now only one leaderboard (weekly) so no need to differentiate in the API. The previous leaderboard
methods are now deprecated and **will be removed** in v1.0.
* Add `create_or_update_weekly_goal` method and specs
* Add `create_or_update_daily_goal` method and specs
* Add `daily_goals` method and update documentation
* Add `delete_body_fat_log` method
* Add `delete_body_weight_log` method
* Add `create_or_update_body_fat_goal` method
* Add `create_or_update_body_weight_goal` method
* Add `log_body_fat` method to push a body fat measurement to Fitbit
* Add `body_fat_goal` method to fetch the current body fat goal
* Add `body_fat` method to fetch body fat measurements
* Add `body_weight` method to fetch body fat measurements
* For the `body_weight` and `body_fat` methods, determine a URI based on the base URI and provided options
